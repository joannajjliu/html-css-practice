# html-css-practice
An assembly of html css practice code

## Folder: smooth-scroll:
From Traversy Media, implements smooth scroll in one of three ways:
#### 1. CSS: 
- includes both smooth scroll, and scroll snapping (scroll-snap-type, and scroll-snap-align)
- not compatible on safari, IE, or Opera

#### 2. JQuery (didn't work):
- imported jQuery CDN in index.html
- did not work, could not find this.hash in document

#### 3. Smooth Scroll CDN:
- imported smooth scroll CDN
- added line of code in main.js to implement only smooth scroll
